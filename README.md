# Shop

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 7.3.8.

## Getting started

# Making requests to the backend API
The source code for the backend server can be found in the [shoppingCart_api](https://github.com/v1try/shoppingCart_api)

Make sure you have the Angular CLI installed globally.
Then run `npm install` to resolve all dependencies (might take a minute).
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
